## Features:

`!!! Web Speech API only supported in Chrome and Android Devices !!!`

    Integration of Web Speech API - Turns speech to text and reads response out loud with default voice. 

    The input can be spoken or typed. 

    Trigger words for the bot: 
    * Hi or hello
    * My name is ${userName}
    * A joke 
    * What time
    * Let's do math
    * Number operator Number - supported operators (addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, and power)
    * Goodbye

## The input can be provided in two ways:
1) Typed in the input field;
2) Can be spoken after pressing `microphone` button.

Unfortunately, only conventional names can be recognized by the API. But, they can be typed in!

Note: I left plenty of comments in HTML and JS files.
